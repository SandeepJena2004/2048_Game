## üß† How the Game Works

| Component       | Details                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Board**       | Represented as a 2D array. Supports moves (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT), spawning new tiles, and checking game-over states. Verifies one merge per tile per move. |
| **Tile Values** | Tiles display powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, ...). Merging creates a tile with double the value.                                                                  |
| **Spawning**    | New tiles (2 or 4) appear in random empty cells after each move.                                                                                         |
| **UI**          | Grid and tiles drawn dynamically. Animations applied for smooth sliding and merges.                                                                      |
| **Score Logic** | Score increases with each merge. Best score is persisted (e.g. via SharedPreferences).                                                                   |
